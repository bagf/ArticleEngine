# Article Engine

Article Engine is a Laravel based application that allows users create, delete, edit and view articles via an easy to use JSON API. It supports non-destructive edits by creating article revisions when changes are applied. Articles can be rolled back or forward to any previous revisions using the provided API calls.

You can request a specified range of articles if you wish to optimize the size of responses. The last two slugs in the request URL determine the list range for example: `GET http://articleengine.app/article/list/10/25` will list 25 articles starting from the 10th latest entry. Optionally you may omit the last slug for example: `GET http://articleengine.app/article/list/25` will list 25 articles starting at the latest entry.
